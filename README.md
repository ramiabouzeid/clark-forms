* To run the application you need to clone the repository, `npm install` and `npm start`
* The application was built on top of react, 
* the questionnaire.json that you provided had all the `required` fields set to false, but in order to test and to make sure that my code is working as expected, I had to change some, same applies for `multiple` flag
* The app is fully responsive with mobile first approach
* I used `redux` for state management, 
* `axios` to emulate fetching data of the endpoint which in this case is `questionnaire.json`, 
* `scss` to style the application where `css3` animations where put in action
* `svgs` were used for the arrows and the logo
* First question is required so try to click on the next arrow without filling it
