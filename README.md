* To run the application you need to clone the repository, `npm install` and `npm start`
* The application was built on top of react, 
* the questionnaire.json that you provided had all the `required` fields set to false, but in order to test and to make sure that my code is working as expected, I had to change some, same applies for `multiple` flag
* The app is fully responsive with mobile first approach
* I used `redux` for state management, 
* `axios` to emulate fetching data of the endpoint which in this case is `questionnaire.json`, 
* `scss` to style the application where `css3` animations where put in action
* `svgs` were used for the arrows and the logo
* First question is required so try to click on the next arrow without filling it

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
